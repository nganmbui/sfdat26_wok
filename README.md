## Project ideas
1. Predicting Customer Churn by looking at their interactions at Zoosk
	* The data is readily available
	* This would have great business impact at Zoosk
	* However, the data might be confidential
2. Kaggle competition: [Classify customer potential] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value)
	* This project is similar that I could potentially use for work
3. Make a recommendation engine for Zoosk business
	* Including predicting who people would like based on their past interactions
	* Again, the data is readily available
	* Confidentiality might not be a problem in this scenario
