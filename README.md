## Project ideas
1. Preidicting Customer Churn by looking at their interactions at Zoosk
	* The data is readily available
	* This would have great business impact at Zoosk
	* However, the data might be confidential
2. Kaggle competition: [Classify customer potential] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/predicting-red-hat-business-value)
	* This project is similar that I could potentially use for work
3. Scrape twitter api
